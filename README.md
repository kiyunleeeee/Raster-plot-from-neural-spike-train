# Raster-plot-from-neural-spike-train
Program generating raster plots from neural spike train


* This program generates raster plots from neural spike train data.
* Unlike other types raster plot, spike is represented as a vertical line, not a dot.
* With the representation of neural activity by vertical lines, it is clearer to see overall activity such as burst and synchrounous firings.
